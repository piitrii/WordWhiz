# WordWhiz
Help children (and parents) to learn vocabulary.

This program can be used as a game-like tool for learning new words. 
It is possible to use prepared word lists e.g. based on a textbook 
chapters or create your own lists of words and their translations 
in Finnish and English.

**Main.py** contains the base code for running the program and asking what 
mode to use.

**ImportCsv.py** is for importing CSV files containing the word lists.

**AskWords.py** asks the translations about the imported word list. It 
also gives feedback on whether the answer was correct or not and calculates 
correct answers.

**PickWordsFromText.py** is a function that can be used as a separate program to 
pick words from a given text, e.g. for creating your own vocabularies.
